# SCC421BlockBasedVBA

This project is an extension of the initial set up for developing VBA using blockly.
The cloned repository that serves as the base for this can be found at: https://github.com/09x09/vba-blockly.git Many thanks to 09x09 for the work up to this point

By extending the project to include more of VBAs functionality, I will demonstrate its use to SMEs. Interviews will then be carried out to see whether block-based programming languages could be useful in helping people in small-medium sized businesses to develop their own advanced macros.
