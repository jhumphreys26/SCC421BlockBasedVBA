# SCC421BlockBasedVBA

This project is an extension of the initial set up for developing VBA using blockly.
The cloned repository that serves as the base for this can be found at: https://github.com/09x09/vba-blockly.git Many thanks to 09x09 for the work up to this point

By extending the project to include more of VBAs functionality, I will demonstrate its use to SMEs. Interviews will then be carried out to see whether block-based programming languages could be useful in helping people in small-medium sized businesses to develop their own advanced macros.

Current extension includes refactoring accessing and mutating data in the same worksheet, along with adding blocks to make accessing and mutating data in different worksheets possible. Added many cell formatting options to allow for greater customization of the cells. Additional support added to applying the above to ranges of cells. Existing text reworded to be simpler and easier to read.
